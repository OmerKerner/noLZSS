"""
Tests for per-sequence FASTA processing functionality.

This module tests the per-sequence FASTA factorization functions including:
- factorize_fasta_dna_w_rc_per_sequence
- factorize_fasta_dna_no_rc_per_sequence
- write_factors_binary_file_fasta_dna_w_rc_per_sequence
- write_factors_binary_file_fasta_dna_no_rc_per_sequence
- count_factors_fasta_dna_w_rc_per_sequence
- count_factors_fasta_dna_no_rc_per_sequence
- parallel versions of write functions

Unlike the concatenated versions (factorize_fasta_multiple_dna_*), these functions
factorize each sequence in the FASTA file independently without using sentinels.
